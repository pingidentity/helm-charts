# Ping Identity
#
# This example starts up a utility sidecar along each PD
# instance in the statefulset. The sidecar should be used
# for running command-line tools like collect-support-data
# and backup.
#
# This example relies on some configuration outside of the
# Helm charts to set up a backup script and a cronjob for
# running the backup. See the files in the pingdirectory-backup
# folder for that configuration. Those resources will need
# to be deployed before the Helm chart is installed.
